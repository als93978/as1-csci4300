1. infoText is not positioned correctly
   - Seemed to be placed at the beginning of headerContainer, but header
   should come before it.
   - This might be an issue with header being absolutely positioned.
   - Priority: Very High

2. Font size for logo is not correct when using span as parent element,
   but is correct when h1 is used as parent element.
   - A solution (using h1 as parent element) is implemented but it would
   be good if this was sorted out.
   - Priority: Low

3. As mentioned above, header being absolutely positioned, as a solution to
   the problem of getting the correct margin-top value for header, might end
   up being a problem.
   - I don't like the idea of absolute positioning, as it may cause problems,
   although technically because its parent element is positioned relative,
   it doesn't seem to affect responsiveness.
   - Priority: Medium, or Very High if determined to be the issue with issue #1.
