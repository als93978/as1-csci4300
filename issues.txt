1. The spacing between the header buttons is not the same
   as the gimp design.
   - Not sure how to get the right values based on the current configuration/positioning system.
   - Priority: Low

2. The solution to getting the header buttons to on the same line seems a bit hacky.
   - Ended up having to expand the width of the headerButtons container to be 25%.
   - It does work, but it seems to be an arbitrary value. For code readability, modularity,
   and maybe future-proofing, I'd like this to be cleaned up if possible.
   - Priority: Medium Low

3. Some of the classes used in the CSS could probably be cleaned up using
   relational selectors, which I have so far neglected to use.
   - Do I need to/should I use them? If so, why?
   - Priority: Low (?)

4. The search button is not aligned correctly (vertically) for Chrome.
   - The height between the search button and the search bar is the same for
   Firefox, but not for Chrome.
   - Probably some kind of compatability issue. Very likely to require a
   completely different way of aligning.
   - Priority: Very High
