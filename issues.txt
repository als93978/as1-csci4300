1. Some of the classes used in the CSS could probably be cleaned up using
   relational selectors, which I have so far neglected to use.
   - Do I need to/should I use them? If so, why?
   - Priority: Low (?)

2. When the window is a smaller height than 1080 (like on a usual 1920x1080 screen),
   the footer and the bottom "SIGN UP" button collide. This is on desktop, not mobile.
   - This can probably be lumped into an overall Responsive Web Design issue. The website
   needs to be much more responsive.
   - Priority: High

3. Multiple positioning and alignment issues exist for mobile.
   - Again, this is a Responsive Web Design issue.
   - Mobile support was not mentioned in the PDF file, however, so I assume it is a
   lower priority for this project, if we are even required to support it at all.
   - But, mobile has a large number of users and is growing fast. Supporting it
   would be nice and a good learning experience if we have time.
   - Priority: Medium

4. Center content div is shifted lower than the other two beside it, for some
   reason.
   - No idea why this is happening.
   - Might need to use vertical-align?
   - Started happening when adding text to the divs. Maybe that has something
   to do with it.
   - Priority: Very High
